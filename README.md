# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project develops a machine learning model for predicting diabetes using clinical data. It employs classification algorithms such as Decision Tree and XGBoost, with hyperparameter tuning for optimization. The model is trained, evaluated, and validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
